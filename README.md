# Blog Post Code
I am writing a blog on Medium outlining my thought process behind a classification project.

The purpose of this project is to aid in my learning of Logistic Regression and other classification methods.

I used a dataset from Kaggle, very easy to find. Please read through my code and see where I can improve!!! Always looking to grow and become better.
